Many people have no garden and would like to be able to access it to enjoy the joy of a garden
or people have a garden and can not take care of it for lack of time because they can not anymore is not maintained.
The idea of this application would be connecting people to barter gardens with services.
Having a garden is not accessible to all but with this application everyone could enjoy the happiness of the garden
and people who can no longer take care of their garden for lack of time,
absence or disability would have a garden maintained by other person in cons part that those there can enjoy this one
